<h1>I am David McFarlane and I’m 19. This is my first year at fanshawe so I’m excited to so what's in store. I was born in London and moved to bayfield when I was 14 but i moved back when I was 16. My hobbies include playing games, watching netflix, and hanging out with friends. I am pretty new to code in general but I am going to try my hardest to get better at it.
